ESP32 is a popular and versatile microcontroller development board that is widely used in the field of Internet of Things (IoT). It is based on the ESP32 system-on-chip (SoC), which combines a dual-core processor with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity.In terms of connectivity, the ESP32 supports both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth protocols, making it easy to integrate with wireless networks and other devices. It provides reliable and secure wireless communication, enabling remote control and data exchange between connected devices.Furthermore, the ESP32 is known for its extensive software support and development ecosystem. It can be programmed using the Arduino IDE or the Espressif IoT Development Framework (ESP-IDF), which provides a robust set of libraries and tools for firmware development. Additionally, there is an active community of developers and enthusiasts who contribute to the development of libraries, examples, and projects on platforms like GitHub.
